<p><a name="Why">Why VLSI?</a>
<br>If you are into electronic/electrical engineering by choice then VLSI must fascinate you, as it offers application of physics, chemistry, mathematics, electronics, and programming-skills in your work.  Also the semiconductor industry rewards the talents with high pay and provides the opportunities across the depth and breadth of technology to ascend the career ladder.
<br>VLSI industry is cynical, but drives the economy. You also get an opportunity to work on the cutting edge technology. In short it's exciting!
<br>
<br><a name="">What is the future of VLSI?</a>
<br>There is an ever increasing amount of semiconductor technology in devices the world depends on for working, communicating, manufacturing, treating illness, and countless other applications. Semiconductor industry will continue to advance in providing solutions for embryonic smart-electronic products for self-driving or driverless cars, smart city infrastructure, Internet of Things (wearables, smart-home products). These products will require essential competencies in manufacturing smart and durable electronic systems, advanced packaging materials, and packaging technology for extreme environmental and high performance conditions.  The latest technological developments in the microelectronics are Finfet, Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography and Multiple Patterning techniques.
<br>The Semiconductor Industry will continue to serve as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.
<br>
<br><a name="">Why do I need training, why VLSI industry is reluctant to hire a fresher?</a>
<br>Training expenses in semiconductor industry are more when compared to software industry due to higher cost of the required tools. Hence the companies expect students to be prepared beforehand on relevant skill-set, like basics and tools (Cadence Virtuoso, Encounter, Spice, Verilog, VHDL).
<br>Graduates, Post-graduates looking for VLSI jobs don't have required knowledge due the lack of college infrastructure, inadequate VLSI expertise in the teaching staff, gap in the industry needs and academics.
<br>
<br><a name="">How are the salaries in VLSI?</a>
<br>Entry level salaries in semiconductor domain are at lower side but, exponentially increase with the work experience. In the long run, as you build your career with continuous learning, skill development, passion, commitment, perseverance and working through the opportunities, you will be duly rewarded.
<br>The salaries then are relatively better than software jobs in India.
