						Kanada Technologies is one of those institutes that trains fresh grads as per the industry needs. I know KT founders very well and they are doing such a great job transforming these fresh grads into industry ready professionals.

						It was and will be a very nice experience for us when you and your team were training our students for "VLSI Design Course" at ECE Dept., JSSATE, Bangalore. Our students say that the training was in detail and highly informative.  The fees was very very less and course content was more than the money they paid.  The students enjoyed and learnt about the VLSI course both theoretically and practically. 
						<br>KTians were very dedicated and punctual in keeping up their promise about the training. Also they are hard working, energetic, knowledgeable and sincere. <br>I wish them all the best in future and let them train more and more students at affordable fees.

						KT provides a best platform for learning. Regarding teaching, its the best, as the faculties are professionals from VLSI companies. I have learnt a lot. The knowledge I acquired @KT is actually helping me a lot at work. I am pretty much impressed with instant doubt clarification and good interaction of faculties @KT. Truly I feel very lucky to be a part of KT.

						I had training from KT and got placed in Sicontech. The training in KT is really good. They teach basics very clearly and also keep a friendly environment so that we can clarify even small doubts also. They make you perfect at theoretical concepts, correlate them by practical implementation on layouts. More number of lab sessions to get good experience on tool. Last thing is they also train you on how to face the questions in interview.

					My Experience with Kanada Technologies was realy good. This was when I started developing interest in VLSI. The hands on experience with the industrial tools and the theory classes helped me to get placed in a VLSI company and thus helped me to persue my masters in VLSI. This course was really helpful for me in selecting my career path and I wish my best regards and thank the KT team for all the support and hard work.

					To talk about Kanada Technologies, I had the best experience of my life when I was undergoing a circuit design course with KT. They have really amazing faculty and combo of classroom and lab session is incredible.
					<br>From day 1, I was taught about the basic MOSFET concepts and introduction to Cadence. Their tutorials material are helpful for all beginner to understand Cadence. All your doubts will we cleared immediately to your satisfaction. The hand on experience that I got on Cadence was really valuable for me as I was looking ahead for a career in VLSI domain. The industry experience shared by faculty members helped me understand the present market requirements and work accordingly towards interviews. The guidance I received while working on my project and the in depth knowledge I received on Cadence is helping me in my Master’s.
					<br>Joining KT was one of my best decision. I am really thankful to all the KT members for teaching and supporting me in every possible way.
					<br>Thank you very much and I wish KT and all the associated members All the Best.
